# Ratiometric-Control-of-bacterial-populations

Code for the validation in silico of the ralay and PI control strategies in the context of solving the ratiometric control problem. The simulations are performed in BSim [1]. The source code for the BSim simulator can be found at https://github.com/CellSimulationLabs/bsim. More details on the simulation parmeters, on the control laws and on the ratiometric control problem can be found in [2].
